First make a virtual environment:
python -m env env

Next install fastapi and uvicorn:
pip install fastapi uvicorn

You will then install appbuilder from Baidu:
pip install --upgrade appbuilder-sdk

You must have python3.9 or above. 
If you don't have it, and you are not in sudoer's file, 
meaning you don't have enough authorization. 

You can actually install python3.9 virtually (ask ChatGPT)

Next, you will also need to install firebase.
